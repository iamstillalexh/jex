If they don't show up after running Jex, just hit the \"file reload\" icon at the top and they should appear. If you're unfamiliar with Google Colab, you can run the code either by going to Runtime->Run All, or you can click the \"play\" icons in the top left of each code block. The first code block is simply to download all of the Python libraries that JEX needs to download and edit video, so you will only need to run it once as long as you do not disconnect from the runtime. The second code block is where you specify which timestamp of which Green Screen Stream you would like to isolate, and that can be run as many times as needed. **Make sure to specify the stream, timestamp, and file name *BEFORE* you run the code block.**"
